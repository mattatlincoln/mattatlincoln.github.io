Let's have a go at coding up the [Babylonian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots), and [more details here](http://personal.bgsu.edu/~carother/babylon/Babylon1.html). A respectable source suggests [it probably was Babylonian](http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/the-best-known-old-babylonian-tablet). You can do it with a few adjustments to the previous example for finding epsilon.\n",

    "So you need your target, $a$, an initial guess for $x_{1}$ and a loop that generates new values of $x_{n}$. Define a stopping criteria - convenient to take the difference (or square of the difference) of the new value of $x_{n+1}$ and the old value $x_{n}$.  "
